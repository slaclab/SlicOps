SlicOps: Beam Physics Control Interface
=======================================

SlicOps controls particle accelerators and beamlines. The web
interface is comprised of SlicLets, componentized applications, which
allow operators to read and write EPICS controls.  The Python library
can be used standalone to control accelerators and beamlines
programmatically.
